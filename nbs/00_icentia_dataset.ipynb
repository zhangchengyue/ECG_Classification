    "## Overview of Icentia11k\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Icentia11k is (as of 2019) the largest public ECG dataset of continuous raw signals containing 11 thousand patients and 2 billion labelled beats.\n",
    "The purpose of the dataset is to enable semi-supervised ECG models to be made as well as to discover unknown subtypes of arrhythmia and anomalous ECG signal events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collection Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The ECG recordings were obtained using a single-lead portable ECG device ([CartioSTAT](https://www.cardiostat.com/) by [Icentia](https://www.icentia.com/)).\n",
    "Patents wore the device betwen 3 - 14 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample rate was 250 Hz. The total dataset size 271.27GB.\n",

    "The dataset conists of ECG recordings for each patient.\n",
    "Patient IDs 9,000 - 10,999 contain fully labelled recordings.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The authors originally intended data from patients 9,000 - 10,999 to be the evaluation subset for unsupervised models trained on partially labelled recordings for patient IDs <9000.\n",
    "However, for our supervised ECG classification task, there is enough data in the intended 'test' set alone to produce a substantial train/test split.\n",
    "However, this means we cannot compare our work to the baseline model performance reported in Tan et al. 2019."

This is because frames from the same segment are associated (e.g. temporally), and segments from the same patient are associated (e.g. because the same patient produces the segments).\n",
